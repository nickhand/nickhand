### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm the Finance, Policy, and Data director for the City of Philadelphia's [@PhilaController](https:/www.github.com/@PhilaController) and teach a [Python geospatial data science course](https://musa-550-fall-2021.github.io) in the Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics at the University of Pennsylvania.

I'm a recovering academic with a Ph.D. in astrophysic from UC Berkeley. I am passionate about data visualization, predictive analytics, and effective communication of complex ideas to a broad audience. I am a strong supporter of transparency in government, open-source software, and the open science framework.

I live in Fairmount in Philadelphia, PA, with my wife, our 7-month-old daughter, and our 5-year-old rescue dog.

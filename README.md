### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a technologist at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://github.com/CFPB) working to detect and prevent unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices in consumer financial services. I also teach a [Python geospatial data science course](https://musa-550-fall-2023.github.io) in the [Masters of Urban Spatial Analytics program](https://www.design.upenn.edu/musa/about) at the University of Pennsylvania. Prior to working at the CFPB, I was the Finance, Policy, and Data director for the City of Philadelphia's [@PhilaController](https://github.com/PhilaController) and 

I'm a former academic with a Ph.D. in astrophysics from UC Berkeley. I am passionate about data visualization, predictive analytics, and effective communication of complex ideas to a broad audience. I am a strong supporter of transparency in government, open-source software, and the open science framework.

I live in the Wissahickon neighborhood of Philadelphia, PA, with my wife, young daughter, and rescue dog.
